# Smash-Hit-Clone
This project is my take on the popular game Smash Hit, developed by Mediocre. My goal was to replicate the core mechanics, visuals, and atmosphere of the original game while creating an engaging and immersive experience.

# Installation
The APK file is available under the **Releases** tab. Download and install it on your Android device to start playing!

# Game Overview
The objective of the game is to navigate through a series of visually stunning levels while managing your supply of balls. Your primary goal is to avoid running out of balls, as this will end your run. Hereâ€™s how the game works:

- **Crystals**: Hit crystals to gain 3 balls. Crystals are your primary resource for replenishing your ball count.
- **Obstacles**: Crashing into obstacles will cost you 10 balls. Avoid them at all costs!
- **Shooting Mechanics**:
  - **Tap**: Quickly tap to shoot a ball with minimum force.
  - **Hold**: Hold to charge the ball, increasing its force and impact.
-  **Progression**: For every 10 crystals hit, you unlock the ability to shoot one additional ball simultaneously, increasing your firepower.
-  **Pause Menu**: Pause the game at any time to restart or resume.
